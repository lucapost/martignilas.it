### Welcome

Our "Martignilas Holiday Home" offers accommodation in the green of the Val Resia (Resia Valley) on the lower slopes of the Canin Mountain in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region.

Our guests are in search of silence and nature, they love animals and relaxing.

"Martignilas holiday home" is ideal for families with children and pets, with a large garden from which you can admire the great view of the Musi mountain range.

It is a great starting point for hiking in the mountains, on foot or by bicycle, and for taking invigorating dips in the streams of Val Resia (Resia Valley).
